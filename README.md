In the 'SurfsUp' folder, you'll find my official submission:
-Climate_gielniak.ipynb is my code to solve the Precipitation and Station Analysis portion of the homework that needed to be done in Jupyter Notebook.  The 'climate_starter.ipynb' file was just used for reference and is the download used to start the homework

-The app.py folder is my python code to create the Climate App.  The code will guide you to a homepage that will list 5 options to navigate to for different information:
1. Precipitation analysis for the last year of data in the Hawaii.sqlite database
2. A list of the stations in that show up in the data
3. A list of dates and temps from the most active station in the previous year from the data
4. The Temperature Min, Max and Average if you supply a start date
5. The Temperature Min, Max and Average if you supply a start and end date
